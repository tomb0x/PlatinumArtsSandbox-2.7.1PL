NOTE TO EDUCATORS - THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS A PART OF THE LICENSE:
If you use this software in an educational setting please send us an e-mail at PlatinumArts@gmail.com and tell us where and how it is being used.  Additonally we'd appreciate feedback on student reaction and how things work out.  Also with your permission we'd like to add your establishment to the list of educational establishments that are using Sandbox.  It would be much appreciated if you posted your experiences here: http://forum.sandboxgamemaker.com/viewforum.php?f=17

Getting an accurate list of schools using Sandbox also helps to get the interest of other schools which helps spread Sandbox to even more kids so that is why it is so important.  Please comply, I do not want to have to change the license to be more restrictive and/or take legal action.  Being noncompliant hurts everyone especially if I have to tighten the license.  Thank you for your time and understanding.
